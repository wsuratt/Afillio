      %ol{:style => "font-size: 16px;"}
        %li
          Navigate to your payment page. If you are a
          %b Seller,
          go to #{link_to 'My Sales', my_sales_orders_path}. If you are a 
          %b Vendor,
          go to #{link_to 'My Orders', my_orders_orders_path}.
        %p
        %li Click the purple "Connect with Stripe" button.
        %p
        %li 
          Fill out the required information.
          %b Tip: if you do not have a business website click "add a product description instead" and enter "Afillio Seller" if you are a Seller or give a product description if you are a Vendor.

          Once you have successfully connected a Stripe account, 
          you should be redirected to your payment page.
          There should now be a blue "Connected with Stripe" link and a green "Payout" button.
